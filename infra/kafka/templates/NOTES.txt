Your Kafka cluster is being deployed using the Strimzi operator.

**Prerequisites:**
- Ensure the Strimzi Kafka operator is already installed in your Kubernetes cluster.

**To verify the deployment:**
Run the following command to check the status of your Kafka cluster:

kubectl get kafka -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ .Release.Name }}-kafka

You can also check the pods created by the Strimzi operator:

kubectl get pods -l strimzi.io/cluster={{ .Release.Name }}-kafka -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}
